# actions

This directory contains Server Actions for Next.js.

Implement functions that connect to databases or external services, excluding screen transitions such as `redirect` in Next.js.

If you need to implement processes that include screen transitions, call the functions implemented in this directory from `page-components` and implement the screen transition process there.
